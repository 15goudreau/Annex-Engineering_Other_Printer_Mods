# Magnetic Microswitch Probes for VORON Machines

Based on the efforts by Mental and the (M)ORON - Mental's VORON printer (for the VORON V1.8 and V2.4 Variants)

These are designed to be "drop-in" replacements for any current voron machine, and greatly exceed the performance of the default inductive probe
